# Quantum state and process tomography

The notebook contains an array of Python functions and routines needed to both simulate and analyse real-world data, when performing both single- and two-qubit quantum state tomography, as well as both standard single- and two-qubit quantum process tomography (using the $\chi$ process matrix formalism).

The notebook is highly commented, with markdown explanations of almost every code block.

## Requirements

The notebook was tested using Visual Studio Code on MacOS in a custom environment, with the following packages installed using conda

* python=3.10
* ipykernel=6.28
* numpy=1.26
* scipy=1.12
* matplotlib=3.9
