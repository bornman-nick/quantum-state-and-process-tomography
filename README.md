# Quantum state and process tomography

The notebook contains an array of Python functions and routines needed to both simulate and analyse real-world data, when performing both single- and two-qubit quantum state tomography, as well as both standard single- and two-qubit quantum process tomography (using the $\chi$ process matrix formalism).

The notebook is highly commented, with markdown explanations of almost every code block.

## Requirements

The notebook was tested using Visual Studio Code on MacOS in a custom Python (version 3.10) environment, with the following packages installed using conda

* ipykernel
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
